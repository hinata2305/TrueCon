This software package is designed to estimate the detectable connectivity between test and retest runs, performing bootstrapping at both the time course and connectome levels, as well as at the sample level. Please be aware that block bootstrapping can be time-consuming.
To run the example, please execute Estimate_ResAuto_TrueConBlockBoot.m and ensure that the file paths are correctly updated.
